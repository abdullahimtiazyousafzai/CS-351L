        "In this game, I started with an existing Treasure Hunt game and made some changes to adapt it. Here's a breakdown of what I did:\n",
        "\n",
        "Game Objective:\n",
        "The player (represented by 'P') needs to reach the exit ('E') while avoiding being caught by the enemy ('C'). The game is played on a grid filled with obstacles ('X'), which block movement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Changes and Features:\n",
        "Grid Creation:\n",
        "\n",
        "I created a 10x10 grid where the player, enemy, exit, and obstacles are placed. The obstacles take up 20% of the grid, randomly positioned, making the game more challenging.\n",
        "Player and Enemy Positions:\n",
        "\n",
        "The player always starts at the top-left corner (0,0), and the exit is placed at the bottom-right corner.\n",
        "The enemy is randomly placed on the grid, but it can't start at the same position as the player or exit.\n",
        "Player Movement:\n",
        "\n",
        "I let the player move using the W (up), A (left), S (down), and D (right) keys. If the player tries to move into an obstacle or off the grid, the move is invalid.\n",
        "*Enemy AI (A Algorithm)**:\n",
        "\n",
        "I changed the enemy's behavior by implementing the A algorithm*. The enemy uses this to find the shortest path to the playerâ€™s current position.\n",
        "The A* algorithm uses Manhattan distance as the heuristic and makes the enemy smarter, as it strategically moves towards the player by calculating the most efficient route around obstacles.\n",
        "Game Loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "The game continues in a loop where the player makes a move and then the enemy follows using the A* algorithm. The game ends when the player reaches the exit or is caught by the enemy.\n",
        "Visuals:\n",
        "\n",
        "I added a simple grid display to make it easier to visualize the game. After each move, the grid is reprinted to show the current positions of the player, enemy, obstacles, and exit.\n",
        "By integrating the A* algorithm, I made the enemy smarter, adding more strategy and challenge to the game compared to the original Treasure Hunt version."
