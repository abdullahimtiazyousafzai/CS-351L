## Lab Task Overview

In this lab, I extended the **Treasure Hunt Game** by implementing a new game scenario as required by the instructions. Below is an explanation of what I did in line with the task instructions:

### **1. A* Algorithm Integration**:
   - I was provided with a version of the game where the **A* algorithm** was already implemented for enemy movement. The A* algorithm uses the Manhattan distance heuristic to calculate the shortest path for the enemy to reach the player while avoiding obstacles.

### **2. New Game Scenario**:
   - I was required to come up with a new game scenario and modify the provided code instead of writing the code from scratch.
   - In my chosen scenario, I altered the gameplay by adjusting the positions of obstacles, changing the enemy's behavior slightly, and making the environment more challenging for the player.
   - The player still needs to reach the exit ('E'), while the enemy uses the A* algorithm to chase the player, but now the new layout and positioning create a different strategic experience.

### **3. Modular and Well-Commented Code**:
   - I ensured that the code is modular and well-commented to explain how the A* algorithm works and how it guides the enemy's movement.
   - Additionally, I added print statements to clearly show each step in the game, ensuring the output looks structured and easy to follow.
